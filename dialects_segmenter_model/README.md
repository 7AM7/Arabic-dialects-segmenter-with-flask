# Dialectal Arabic Segmenter 
Dialectal Arabic Segmenter is a freeware module developed by the ALT team at Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) to process Dialectal Arabic. The segmenter is built using a collection of tweets from frour regions - Egypt, Gulf, Maghrib and Levantine.
 
Arabic Dialects Segmenter implemented using Keras/BiLSTM/ChainCRF. 

# Requirements

This segmenter requires the following packages:

- Python version 3.6
    
- `tensorflow` version 2.4 or later: https://www.tensorflow.org
- `nltk` version 3.5 or later

## Installation

You can install the Dialectal Arabic Segmenter by cloning the repo:

### Installing Dialectal Arabic Segmenter from github
Clone the repo from the github using the following command:
```
https://github.com/7AM7/Arabic-dialects-segmenter-with-flask
```
Or download the compressed file of the project, extract it.

## Getting started
Dialectal Arabic Segmenter reads an input Arabic text  file from the stdin and produces the segmentation line per line. The segmenter expects the input file encoded in ``UTF-8``,
```
python dialects_segmenter_model/code/dialects_segmenter.py -i [in-file] -o [out-file] 
```

For more details see:

``` 
python dialects_segmenter_model/code/dialects_segmenter.py -h
```
